% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two
% commands used to separate the names and addresses of multiple
% authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to
% break the lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So,
% if LaTeX puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last
% on the second line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third
% author name.

	\begin{abstract}
		We propose a sensor acquisition problem (SAP) wherein sensors (and sensing tests) are organized into a cascaded architecture and the goal is to choose a test with the optimal cost-accuracy tradeoff for a given instance. We consider the case where we obtain no feedback in terms of rewards for our chosen actions apart from test observations. Absence of feedback raises fundamentally new challenges since one cannot infer potentially optimal tests. We pose the problem in terms of competitive optimality with the goal of minimizing cumulative regret against optimally chosen actions in hindsight. In this context we introduce the notion of weak dominance and show that it is necessary and sufficient for realizing sub-linear regret. Weak dominance on a cascade supposes that a child node in the cascade has higher accuracy when its parent node makes correct predictions. When weak dominance holds we show that we can reduce SAP to a corresponding multi-armed bandit problem with side observations. Empirically we verify that weak dominance holds for many datasets.

%\todoc{However, the crowdsourcing model is also unidentifiable in a strict sense; and the rank one assumption is what saves the day there.}
%\section{Calibrating the sensors}
%In this sections we assume that the predictions accuracy can be controlled. Let $\hat{\hat{y}}^i_t$ denote the measurement output by device-i in round $t$. The prediction of device-i is given by 
%\begin{equation}
%\hat{y}^i_t=\mbox{sign}(\hat{\hat{y}}^i_t-\eta_i)
%\end{equation}
%where $\eta_i \in \mathcal{R}$ is the calibration parameter set by the learner. Thus, setting $\eta_i$ the learner can control the prediction accuracy of the devices.  A policy involves selecting a device and setting its calibration parameter in each round. The goal is to learn a policy that minimizes the expected regret defined in \ref{eqn:Regret2Actions}.    

%\section{Relationship to crowdsourcing}
%A basic problem formulation in crowdsourcing is the following:%
%\footnote{
%	See
%	\url{https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/handle/10012/9841/Szepesvari_David.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y}
%	and the references therein.}
%One is given a $W \times T$ table $Y$ of binary labels (for convenience, $Y\in \{\pm \}^{W\times T}$), the $(w,t)$th entry $Y_{wt}$ in the table corresponding to the response of worker $w$ for task $t$. 
%It is assumed that the performance of each worker is stable across the tasks and that tasks are also randomly chosen from a fixed distribution. More precisely, $Y_{w,t} = (\xi_{w,t,-1} \one{ Y^*_t=-1} + \xi_{w,t,+1}  \one{ Y^*_t=+1}) Y^*_{t}$, where $Y^*_{t}\in \{\pm 1\}$ is the ``true'' unobserved label, $\xi_{w,t,y}\in \{\pm 1\}$ is the variable that indicates corruption of label $y\in \{\pm 1\}$ of worker $w$ in task $t$. It is assumed that $(Y^*_t)_{1\le t\le T}$, $(\xi_{w,t,y})_{w,t,y}$ are mutually independent of each other,
%while $Y^*_t \sim_D Y^*_{t'}$ and $\xi_{w,t,y} \sim_D \xi_{w,t',y}$ for any $t,t',w,y$.
%The joint distribution of the random variables in the observed table $Y$ is thus uniquely determined by the probabilities $\Prob{ Y^*_1 = +1 }$ and $\Prob{ \xi_{w,1,y} = +1 }$, $1\le w \le W$, $y\in \{\pm 1\}$. The model described dates back to the work of Dawid and Skene in 1979.\footnote{Dawid,  P.,  Skene,  A. M.,  Dawid,  A. P.,  and Skene,  A. M. (1979).  Maximum likelihood
%	estimation  of  observer  error-rates  using  the  EM  algorithm. Applied  Statistics,  pages 20--28.}
%
%One basic task in crowdsourcing is to infer the values of $(Y_t^*)_{1\le t\le T}$ given the observed table $Y$. This is called the inference problem (this is often studied even in the lack of assumptions on the task generation process). Very often, this is studied under the so-called symmetric noise assumption when $\xi_{w,t,y}$ and $\xi_{w,t,-y}$ are identically distributed. In this case, the optimal way to aggregate the labels provided by the workers is to use a weighted majority vote, i.e., using $\sgn( \sum_{w=1}^W v_w Y_{w,t} )$ to predict the label for task $t$, where $v_w^* = \ln( \frac{1+s_w^*}{1-s_w^*} )$ and $s_w^* = \Prob{\xi_{w,1,1}=1}-\Prob{\xi_{w,1,1}=-1}$ denotes the ``skillfulness'' of worker $w$.  In the lack of the knowledge of worker skill levels, the skills are estimated. This is based on writing $Y_{w,t} = \xi_{w,t} Y^*_t = s_w^* Y^*_t + Z_{w,t} Y_t^*$, where $\EE{Z_{w,t}|Y^*_t} = 0$ and we used that $\EE{ \xi_{w,t,1}|Y^*_t} = s_w^*$. Thus, $Y$ can be viewed as a noisy observation of a rank-one matrix.
%
%Note that in the lack of the symmetry assumption, the rank-one approximation becomes a rank-two approximation, a case, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been studied theoretically in the literature so far.

%\section{Dependence of $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ on a Discrete Space of $x_t$}
%\subsection{Independence Across Symbols}
%Equivalent to playing multiple constant problems in parallel.
%\subsection{Smoothness Assumption}
%Assume $\|\gamma_1(x_1)-\gamma_1(x_2)\|\leq \beta \|x_1-x_2\|$ and $\|\gamma_2(x_1)-\gamma_2(x_2)\|\leq \beta \|x_1-x_2\|$ for all $x_1,x_2$. Now observations for a single value of $x_t$ are informative across the space of discrete $x$. How does this change the algorithm/performance? This should generalize to the continuous space of $x$.
